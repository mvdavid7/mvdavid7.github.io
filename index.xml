      <description>And so 2020: Round Two comes to a close.
After the crazy year that was 2020, 2021 was a welcome change of pace. Even if still not really back to normal. C&amp;rsquo;mon 2022, I believe in you!
This year the girls ages are even, and their school grades are odd (yes, this is how my brain tracks these things, welcome to my mind). So I have a twelve, a ten, and an eight year old - respectively 7th, 5th, and 3rd grader - running around this house.</description>

      <description>2020, what a ride.
How does one begin a Christmas letter anyways.
The year started innocently enough. I think. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember much about The Before Times. Except that I did get to host a Super Bowl party. And I was excited to do it again in 2021&amp;hellip; There goes that plan.
 This girl turned 11!
  Mariah turned 11 this year. And she already acts like a teenager, so wish me luck.</description>
