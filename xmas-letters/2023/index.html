  "articleBody": "You would think after having done this three times before, I would have some sort of clue about how to start this year’s Christmas Letter. Well the joke’s on you, I still have no idea what I’m doing… so let’s get into it.\nReflecting on 2023, I am very grateful for each and every one of you. That’s right, this is my Oscar’s speech moment. I am grateful for all the friendships that started, continued, or even reconnected this year. I’m grateful for all of you by my side and the encouragement you bring every day. It’s only taken 30+ years for this introvert to realize that alas, I cannot do it all on my own.\nAs always, I hope this letter allows us to feel a little connected, even in the midst of the craziness that is life. A quick glimpse at our household that might just bring us together. Trying to bring a sense of community to our mostly online world.\nAnd of course, you do not have to read everything in this letter. I will give you a table of contents right here (it’s on you if you choose to put up with all of my writing and weird jokes):\n(I also asked the girls once again for input, so be on the lookout for what they are most thankful for this year and what they are looking forward to next)\nWhat most people are here for (I’ll give you a clue, it’s not me): Mariah - Mikaela - Merida What some people probably think belongs at the very top: cat updates What people put up with reading, as long as I also talk about the other things: travels near and far And finally, what no one ever asks for, but that won’t stop me cause this is my website: an emotional look back at 2023 Wherever you are, whatever you are up to, may your holidays be like a slice of NY pizza straight out of the oven: comforting, wonderful, and warm.\nWishing you a Merry Christmas! Your friends that keep showing up to RPI Hockey games, even in the midst of a disastrous season, The Andrades.\nMariah JV Soccer!\nShe’s in High School. I repeat. She’s IN HIGH SCHOOL. How. Did. This. Happen. Still loves soccer, but even made some time for Spring Track earlier this year. We may have our moments… (Mariah, if you’re reading this, go clean your room) but watching her grow up is great. She keeps taking on more responsibilities, developing closer friendships, and becoming more independent. Hopefully I’m not making a mess of things too much as I try to take it all in. She’s funny. She’s determined. She’s fast and athletic. She loves to make fun of me. Good times.\nShe’s thankful for deep bonds she’s created with people this year. And she’s looking forward to her travel soccer team hopefully making it to nationals next year!\nMikaela Cute\nShe’s very curious, which keeps life interesting with her. She has started to bake with me a lot, which has been great. Of course, gymnastics makes up the majority of her life, with just enough time to hang out with her friends and somehow get all her schoolwork done. Oh to be young again. This child loves her sarcasm, but don’t let that fool you. There’s empathy and kindness in there too. She’s smart and she’s a planner. Perhaps sometimes overly so (that might be my bad…). She also loves to make fun of me. Again, good times.\nShe’s thankful for her trips and vacations this year, and she’s looking forward to more time with family and friends the next.\nMerida Goofball\nIt is tough to not think of her as the baby any more, but she’s in 5th grade! Most definitely no longer the baby. She even got glasses this year, completing the whole getting older look. (My eyesight genes did not help her chances…) She took up the Saxophone this year for band, and she seems to be loving it so far. Still of course playing and loving soccer too. She’s goofy, wild, and unpredictable. But boy is she funny and affectionate. Even if she does love to make fun of me. (Do you see the pattern here?)\nShe’s thankful for her friends and family this year, and looking forward to playing soccer with her team and spending time with her friends the next.\nTroublemakers Living their best life\nWhat is there to say here? Sophie is still the calm, cool, and collected one. But Bear might as well be a dog. Needy (must be where the people are), up to no good (the number of things he has knocked down is too high), and loud (you can hear him from the other side of the house). But they are always fun, keep us company, and certainly keep things interesting.\nFamily Travels The Millennium Falcon!\nWe got to finally visit my parents, my brother, and his family, down in Florida this year. We went during spring break, cause no way I’m stepping foot in that state during summer. Was the whole trip just an excuse for me to spend the day at Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge? The world will never know. What we do know is that it’s an amazing place and I want to go back.\nIt’s always neat taking the girls to new places and watch them experience different things. Even if not all are a hit, I sure hope the memories they made are good ones. (I got to pilot the Millennium Falcon, my memories are epic)\nYearly (almost) Wildwood Vacation\nBut visiting familiar places is great too. We got to go back to Wildwood, NJ this summer. The beach was awesome as always (the sunburns, not so much). The bike ride on the boardwalk was a fun new experience, even if I may have pushed us too far (the girls were quick to note it). And of course the food was epic. Nothing crazy or wild, but certainly a nice tradition that I’m glad we can keep alive.\nSolo Trip - Ecuador Mitad del Mundo: A monument at the equator\nI could talk about this trip for hours. I’ll try not to (no promises though).\nIt was my first time back in over 18 years. Everything felt familiar, yet different. Plenty of things instantly brought up feelings of nostalgia, transporting me back to when I was a kid biking around the streets of Quito (wildly unsupervised…). But at the same time, plenty of things looked vastly different, leaving me feeling kinda lost in the place I once called home. It brought me joy to see people and places I grew up with, and at the same time I was filled with sorrow for all the missed years. Boy being a human with emotions is a complex thing.\nQuito is huge\nOne thing is for certain, Quito has grown. Places that I remember being no more than empty plots of land in between destinations, are now full of life on their own. The hillsides that were difficult enough to navigate through when they were empty, now have apartments and buildings all over. It seems like every inch of the wild landscape that is Quito and its surrounding areas is now occupied. Time for sure changed things down there.\nQuilotoa was gorgeous\nMan, 10 year old David for sure did not realize how good he had it. Sights and wonders so strikingly beautiful just outside my door (waking up to a view of snow capped volcanoes surrounding the city will never get old). And the food! The ridiculously delicious food. The food I wish everyone could try but am afraid to make cause I know I won’t do it justice. The flavors so unique to that area that I can’t quite find up here (turns out Upstate NY is not a hub of South American produce imports, who knew). All I know is that I will forever apologize to my mom for all the hard time I gave her about meals when I was little…\nSo much more I could say about this trip, but honestly, in some ways I’m still processing it. I knew this trip was going to be a very emotional one, yet I still think I underestimated just how many feelings it was going to bring to the surface. One thing is for sure, I’m so grateful I was able to go back.\nThanks to all my family down there that made me feel at home, gave me a place to stay, made some amazing food, and made those few days so memorable. I love you all!\nPutting a bow on it Looking back, there was no one crazy wild moment that forever changed us this year, yet add all the little moments together and of course this year was big. It is good to see that we were indeed moving forward, even if at the time, the changes seemed almost imperceptible. Certainly, I hope I’ve grown this year. That I’ve changed for the better. That I’ve made an impact on the girls’ lives. (It certainly will be nice to make less, err, different mistakes next year)\nI guess that’s part of why I write this. To look back and see the big picture. And it always helps me to remember all blessings of the year. I’m grateful for the big moments, and the small. Be it as wild as the game launches I got to be a part of (Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1, ahhh!!!). Or be it as simple as discovering a new trail to walk with the girls (like Christman Sanctuary). Hopefully I won’t take this all for granted, specially not during the tough times when they come: God has been good through it all.\nOnce again, thanks to all of you that make such an impact in my life. And if you made it all the way to the end of this letter, boy you really do deserve a great holiday season!\n🎄🎄🎄 MERRY CHRISTMAS 🎄🎄🎄 ",

<p>But visiting familiar places is great too. We got to go back to Wildwood, NJ this summer. The beach was awesome as always (the sunburns, not so much). The bike ride on the boardwalk was a fun new experience, even if I may have pushed us too far (the girls were quick to note it). And of course the food was epic. Nothing crazy or wild, but certainly a nice tradition that I&rsquo;m glad we can keep alive.</p>

<p>I could talk about this trip for hours. I&rsquo;ll try not to (no promises though).</p>
<p>It was my first time back in over 18 years. Everything felt familiar, yet different. Plenty of things instantly brought up feelings of nostalgia, transporting me back to when I was a kid biking around the streets of Quito (wildly unsupervised&hellip;). But at the same time, plenty of things looked vastly different, leaving me feeling kinda lost in the place I once called home. It brought me joy to see people and places I grew up with, and at the same time I was filled with sorrow for all the missed years. Boy being a human with emotions is a complex thing.</p>

<p>One thing is for certain, Quito has grown. Places that I remember being no more than empty plots of land in between destinations, are now full of life on their own. The hillsides that were difficult enough to navigate through when they were empty, now have apartments and buildings all over. It seems like every inch of the wild landscape that is Quito and its surrounding areas is now occupied. Time for sure changed things down there.</p>

<p>Man, 10 year old David for sure did not realize how good he had it. Sights and wonders so strikingly beautiful just outside my door (waking up to a view of snow capped volcanoes surrounding the city will never get old). And the food! The ridiculously delicious food. The food I wish everyone could try but am afraid to make cause I know I won&rsquo;t do it justice. The flavors so unique to that area that I can&rsquo;t quite find up here (turns out Upstate NY is not a hub of South American produce imports, who knew). All I know is that I will forever apologize to my mom for all the hard time I gave her about meals when I was little&hellip;</p>
<p>So much more I could say about this trip, but honestly, in some ways I&rsquo;m still processing it. I knew this trip was going to be a very emotional one, yet I still think I underestimated just how many feelings it was going to bring to the surface. One thing is for sure, I&rsquo;m so grateful I was able to go back.</p>
<p>Thanks to all my family down there that made me feel at home, gave me a place to stay, made some amazing food, and made those few days so memorable. I love you all!</p>

<p>Looking back, there was no one crazy wild moment that forever changed us this year, yet add all the little moments together and of course this year was big. It is good to see that we were indeed moving forward, even if at the time, the changes seemed almost imperceptible. Certainly, I hope I&rsquo;ve grown this year. That I&rsquo;ve changed for the better. That I&rsquo;ve made an impact on the girls&rsquo; lives. (It certainly will be nice to make less, err, different mistakes next year)</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s part of why I write this. To look back and see the big picture. And it always helps me to remember all blessings of the year. I&rsquo;m grateful for the big moments, and the small. Be it as wild as the game launches I got to be a part of (<a href="https://www.hogwartslegacy.com/en-us">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.mortalkombat.com/en-us">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, ahhh!!!). Or be it as simple as discovering a new trail to walk with the girls (like <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/eny-christman-sanctuary/">Christman Sanctuary</a>). Hopefully I won&rsquo;t take this all for granted, specially not during the tough times when they come: God has been good through it all.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks to all of you that make such an impact in my life.
And if you made it all the way to the end of this letter, boy you really do deserve a great holiday season!</p>
