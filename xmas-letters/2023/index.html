  "articleBody": "You would think after having done this three times before, I would have some sort of clue about how to start this year’s Christmas Letter. Well the joke’s on you, I still have no idea what I’m doing… so let’s get into it.\nReflecting on 2023, I am very grateful for each and every one of you. That’s right, this is my Oscar’s speech moment. I am grateful for all the friendships that started, continued, or even reconnected this year. I’m grateful for all of you by my side and the encouragement you bring every day. It’s only taken 30+ years for this introvert to realize that alas, I cannot do it all on my own.\nAs always, I hope this letter allows us to feel a little connected, even in the midst of the craziness that is life. A quick glimpse at our household that might just bring us together. I also asked the girls once again for help here, so be on the lookout for what they are most thankful for this year and what they are looking forward to next.\nAnd of course, you do not have to read everything in this letter. I will give you a table of contents right here (it’s on you if you choose to put up with all of my writing and weird jokes):\n What most people are here for (I’ll give you a clue, it’s not me): Mariah - Mikaela - Merida What some people probably think belongs at the very top: cat updates What people put up with, as long as I also talk about the other things: travels near and far And finally, what no one ever asks for, but it won’t stop me cause this is my website: an emotional look back at 2023  May your holidays be like a slice of NY pizza straight out of the oven: comforting, wonderful, and warm.\nYour friends that keep showing up to RPI Hockey games, even in the midst of a disastrous season, The Andrades.\nMariah She’s in High School. I repeat. She’s IN HIGH SCHOOL. How. Did. This. Happen. Still loves soccer, but even made some time for Spring Track earlier this year. We may have our moments… (Mariah, if you’re reading this go clean your room) but watching her grow up is great. Taking on more responsibilities. Hopefully I’m not making a mess of things too much. She’s funny. She’s determined. She’s fast and athletic. She loves to make fun of me. Good times.\nTHankful for bonds she’s created with people. real bonds Hopefully making it to nationals\nMikaela Gymnastics, do i need to really say much here? This child loves her sarcasm, but don’t let that fool you. There’s empathy and kindness in there too. She’s smart and a planner. Perhaps sometimes overly so (that might be my bad…)\nMerida It is tough to not think of her as the baby any more, but she’s in 5th grade! Most definitely no longer the baby. She took up the Saxophone this year. She’s loving it so far. Still playing and loving soccer too. She’s goofy, wild, and unpredictable. But boy is she funny and affectionate.\nThankful for friends and family.\nTroublemakers Family Travels We got to finally visit my parents and brother and family down in Florida. We went during spring break, cause no way I’m stepping foot in that state during summer. Was the whole trip just an excuse for me to spend the day at Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge? We will never know. It’s always fun to take the girls to new places.\nBut visiting familiar places is great too. We got to go back to Wildwood . The beach (and the sunburns). We even finally rode bikes on the boardwalk. Turns out\nEcuador First time back in over 18 years. Everything felt familiar yet different, all at once. Plenty of things instantly brought feelings of nostalgia as I was transported back to when i was a kid biking around the streets of Quito, wildly unsupervised, yet. And plenty of things looked vastly different, leaving me almost lost in a place I once called home. It brought me joy to see people and places I grew up with, and at the same time I was filled with sorrow for all the missed years. Boy being a human with emotions is a complex thing.\nOne thing is for certain, Quito has grown. Places that I remember being no more than empty plots of land in between destinations, are now full of life on their own. The hillsides that were difficult enough to navigate through when they were empty, now have apartments and buildings all over. It seems like every inch of the mountainous landscape that is Quito and its surrounding areas is now occupied. Time has for sure changed things down there.\nLastly, man 10 year old David for sure did not realize how good he had it. Sights and wonders so strikingly beautiful just outside my door (waking up to a view of snow capped volcanoes surrounding the city did not get old). And the food. The ridiculously delicious food. The food I wish everyone could try but am afraid to make cause I know I won’t do it justice. The flavors that are unique to that area and can’t quite find easily anywhere else (certainly not Upstate NY anyways). Will forever apologize to my mom for all the hard time I gave her about meals when I was little…\nPutting a bow on it Looking back, there was no one crazy wild moment that forever changed us this year, yet add all the little moments together and of course this year was big. It is good to see that we were indeed moving forward, even if at the time, the changes seemed almost imperceptible.\nTaking the time to write this letter always helps me remember all blessings of the year. It helps me make sure I don’t take things for granted. And it keeps me grateful, even during the lows of life.\nI hope I’ve grown this year. That I’ve changed for the better. That I’ve made an impact on the girls' lives.\nHogwarts Legacy and MK1\nThanks for reading. I hope you have a great holiday season!\n🎄🎄🎄 MERRY CHRISTMAS 🎄🎄🎄 ",
