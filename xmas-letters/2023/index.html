  "articleBody": "You would think after having done this three times before, I would have some sort of clue about how to start this year’s Christmas Letter. Well the joke’s on you, I still have no idea what I’m doing… so let’s get into it.\nReflecting on 2023, I am very grateful for each and every one of you. That’s right, this is my Oscar’s speech moment. I am grateful for all the friendships that started, continued, or even reconnected this year. I’m grateful for all of you by my side and the encouragement you bring every day. It’s only taken 30+ years for this introvert to realize that alas, I cannot do it all on my own.\nAs always, I hope this letter allows us to feel a little connected, even in the midst of the craziness that is life. A quick glimpse at our household that might just bring us together. Trying to bring a sense of community to our mostly online world.\nI also asked the girls once again for help here, so be on the lookout for what they are most thankful for this year and what they are looking forward to next.\nAnd of course, you do not have to read everything in this letter. I will give you a table of contents right here (it’s on you if you choose to put up with all of my writing and weird jokes):\n What most people are here for (I’ll give you a clue, it’s not me): Mariah - Mikaela - Merida What some people probably think belongs at the very top: cat updates What people put up with, as long as I also talk about the other things: travels near and far And finally, what no one ever asks for, but it won’t stop me cause this is my website: an emotional look back at 2023  Wherever you are, whatever you are up to, may your holidays be like a slice of NY pizza straight out of the oven: comforting, wonderful, and warm.\nWishing you a Merry Christmas! Your friends that keep showing up to RPI Hockey games, even in the midst of a disastrous season, The Andrades.\nMariah  JV Soccer!\n  She’s in High School. I repeat. She’s IN HIGH SCHOOL. How. Did. This. Happen. Still loves soccer, but even made some time for Spring Track earlier this year. We may have our moments… (Mariah, if you’re reading this go clean your room) but watching her grow up is great. She keeps taking on more responsibilities, developing closer friendships, and becoming more independent. Hopefully I’m not making a mess of things too much as I try to take it all in. She’s funny. She’s determined. She’s fast and athletic. She loves to make fun of me. Good times.\nShe’s thankful for deep bonds she’s created with people this year. And she’s looking forward to her travel soccer team hopefully making it to nationals next year!\nMikaela  Cute\n  She’s very curious, which keeps life interesting with her. She has started to bake with me a lot, which has been great. Of course, gymnastics makes up the majority of her life, with just enough time to hang out with her friends and somehow get all her schoolwork done. Oh to be young again. This child loves her sarcasm, but don’t let that fool you. There’s empathy and kindness in there too. She’s smart and she’s a planner. Perhaps sometimes overly so (that might be my bad…). She also loves to make fun of me. Again, good times.\nShe’s thankful for her trips and vacations this year, and she’s looking forward to more time with family and friends the next\nMerida  Goofball\n  It is tough to not think of her as the baby any more, but she’s in 5th grade! Most definitely no longer the baby. She even got glasses this year (sorry for my poor genetics when it comes to eyesight…). She took up the Saxophone this year for band, and she seems to be loving it so far. Still of course playing and loving soccer too. She’s goofy, wild, and unpredictable. But boy is she funny and affectionate. Even if she does love to make fun of me (do you see the pattern here?)\nShe’s thankful for her friends and family this year, and looking forward to playing soccer with her team and spending time with her friends the next.\nTroublemakers Family Travels  The Millennium Falcon!\n  We got to finally visit my parents and brother his family down in Florida. We went during spring break, cause no way I’m stepping foot in that state during summer. Was the whole trip just an excuse for me to spend the day at Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge? The world will never know. What we do know is that it’s an amazing place and I want to go back.\nIt’s always neat taking the girls to new places and watch them experience different things. Even if not all are a hit, I sure hope the memories we made are good ones.\n Yearly (almost) Wildwood Vacation\n  But visiting familiar places is great too. We got to go back to Wildwood, NJ this summer. The beach was awesome as always (the sunburns, not so much). The bike ride on the boardwalk was a fun new experience (not so fun: the complaining that I was pushing us too far). And of course the food was epic (the one thing there was probably no complaints about). Nothing crazy or wild, but certainly a nice tradition that I’m glad we can keep alive.\nEcuador  Mitad del Mundo: A monument at the equator\n  This trip. Wow. I could talk about it for hours. I’ll try not to. No promises though.\nIt was my first time back in over 18 years. Everything felt familiar yet different, all at once. Plenty of things instantly brought feelings of nostalgia as I was transported back to when I was a kid biking around the streets of Quito (wildly unsupervised…) But at the same time, plenty of things looked vastly different, leaving me feeling almost lost in a place I once called home. It brought me joy to see people and places I grew up with, and at the same time I was filled with sorrow for all the missed years. Boy being a human with emotions is a complex thing.\n Quito is huge\n  One thing is for certain, Quito has grown. Places that I remember being no more than empty plots of land in between destinations, are now full of life on their own. The hillsides that were difficult enough to navigate through when they were empty, now have apartments and buildings all over. It seems like every inch of the mountainous landscape that is Quito and its surrounding areas is now occupied. Time has for sure changed things down there.\n Quilotoa was gorgeous\n  Man, 10 year old David for sure did not realize how good he had it. Sights and wonders so strikingly beautiful just outside my door (waking up to a view of snow capped volcanoes surrounding the city will never get old). And the food! The ridiculously delicious food. The food I wish everyone could try but am afraid to make cause I know I won’t do it justice. The flavors that are unique to that area and can’t quite find easily anywhere else (certainly not Upstate NY anyways). I will forever apologize to my mom for all the hard time I gave her about meals when I was little…\nSo much I could say about this trip, but honestly, in some ways I’m still processing it. I knew this trip was going to be a very emotional one, yet I still think I underestimated just how many feelings it was going to bring to the surface. One thing is for sure, I’m so grateful I was able to go back.\nPutting a bow on it Looking back, there was no one crazy wild moment that forever changed us this year, yet add all the little moments together and of course this year was big. It is good to see that we were indeed moving forward, even if at the time, the changes seemed almost imperceptible. Certainly, I hope I’ve grown this year. That I’ve changed for the better. That I’ve made an impact on the girls' lives.\nI guess that’s part of why I write this. To look back and see the big picture. And it always helps me remember all blessings of the year. It helps me make sure I don’t take things for granted. And it keeps me grateful, even during the lows of life. I’m grateful for the big moments, and the small. Be it the crazy game launches I got to be a part of (Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1!!!). Or be it discovering a new trail to walk with the girls (in this case, Christman Sanctuary). God has been good through it all.\nIf you made it all the way to the end, boy you really do deserve a great holiday season!\n🎄🎄🎄 MERRY CHRISTMAS 🎄🎄🎄 ",

<p>Man, 10 year old David for sure did not realize how good he had it. Sights and wonders so strikingly beautiful just outside my door (waking up to a view of snow capped volcanoes surrounding the city will never get old). And the food! The ridiculously delicious food. The food I wish everyone could try but am afraid to make cause I know I won&rsquo;t do it justice. The flavors that are unique to that area and can&rsquo;t quite find easily anywhere else (certainly not Upstate NY anyways). I will forever apologize to my mom for all the hard time I gave her about meals when I was little&hellip;</p>
<p>So much I could say about this trip, but honestly, in some ways I&rsquo;m still processing it. I knew this trip was going to be a very emotional one, yet I still think I underestimated just how many feelings it was going to bring to the surface. One thing is for sure, I&rsquo;m so grateful I was able to go back.</p>

<p>Looking back, there was no one crazy wild moment that forever changed us this year, yet add all the little moments together and of course this year was big. It is good to see that we were indeed moving forward, even if at the time, the changes seemed almost imperceptible. Certainly, I hope I&rsquo;ve grown this year. That I&rsquo;ve changed for the better. That I&rsquo;ve made an impact on the girls' lives.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s part of why I write this. To look back and see the big picture. And it always helps me remember all blessings of the year. It helps me make sure I don&rsquo;t take things for granted. And it keeps me grateful, even during the lows of life. I&rsquo;m grateful for the big moments, and the small. Be it the crazy game launches I got to be a part of (Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1!!!). Or be it discovering a new trail to walk with the girls (in this case, Christman Sanctuary). God has been good through it all.</p>
<p>If you made it all the way to the end, boy you really do deserve a great holiday season!</p>
